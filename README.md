# LT2326-Assignment-2

This repository contains my assignment submission for the second assignment of LT2326. It consists of only one notebook file which contains all my code. Since I am not uploading any model checkpoints, some code cells will not be runnable (especially in the evaluation part). I organized my code and outputs so that it should be clear what I did and what results I got, even without rerunning any of the code. 

Notes about the code and results are also in the notebook file, close to the block of code they pertain to. A short discussion and conclusion can be found at the end of the notebook.
